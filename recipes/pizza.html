    <h2>Steps To Follow</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
            <ul>
                 <li>
                    Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 500°F or 260°C). 
                    If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating
                 </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface into your desired thickness.
                    If you prefer a thinner crust, roll it out more.
                    For a thicker crust, leave it a bit thicker.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
                    If using a pizza stone, ensure it's well-floured or use a pizza peel with a bit of cornmeal to prevent sticking.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface into your desired thickness.
                    If you prefer a thinner crust, roll it out more.
                    For a thicker crust, leave it a bit thicker.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Add the Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, 
                    leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Add the Cheese:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Arrange the slices or pieces of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce. 
                    Make sure it covers the pizza evenly.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sprinkle with Basil:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Place fresh basil leaves on top of the cheese. 
                    You can use them whole or tear them into smaller pieces for a more rustic look.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza. 
                    This adds flavor and helps to brown the crust.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Season and Optional Cheese:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. 
                    If desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top for an extra cheesy kick.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. 
                    Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute before slicing. 
                    Serve hot and enjoy!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
