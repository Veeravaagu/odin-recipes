         Each bite is a journey through the essence of Italian cuisine, capturing the essence of a warm summer day in Naples.</p>

                 <li>
                    Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 500°F or 260°C). 
                    If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating
